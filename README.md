### Getting Started
Install python 3 (warren is currently using 3.7.6).

Run the following code to get a virtual environment created and packages installed.
```
python -m venv stmlenv
stmlenv/Scripts/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
The first line creates a folder "stmlenv" which houses a virtual python environment. The second line activates the environment (you might need to use stmlenv/bin/activate?). The last line installs packages. If you want to create a new requirements.txt file or update the existing file:
```
pip freeze > requirements.txt
or 
pip freeze > my_requirements.txt
```
